# OpenGL-AdvancedGLSL

## Description

Experiments and implementations of advanced GLSL rendering techniques in C++, including custom shaders and effects. This repository demonstrates various advanced techniques for creating visually appealing and efficient graphics.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries:

*   **OpenGL:** The core graphics API. This project requires OpenGL version [Specify OpenGL Version]. Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date.

*   **GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library):** Used to manage OpenGL extensions.

    *   **Download:** [https://github.com/nigels-com/glew]
    *   **Installation:**
        1.  Download the GLEW source code.
        2.  Build GLEW using the provided Visual Studio solution (`glew.sln`) in the `build\vc15` directory (or a compatible version).
        3.  Copy the `glew32.dll` (from `lib\Release\Win32` or `lib\Release\x64` depending on your build) to your project's executable directory (where the `.exe` file will be).
        4.  Copy the GLEW header files (from `include\GL`) to your project's include directory.
        5.  Link against `glew32.lib` and `opengl32.lib` in your Visual Studio project settings (see Build Instructions below).

*   **GLM (OpenGL Mathematics):** A header-only C++ mathematics library used for vector, matrix, and quaternion operations.

    *   **Download:** [https://github.com/g-truc/glm]
    *   **Installation:**
        1.  Download the GLM source code.
        2.  Copy the `glm` directory to your project's include directory. GLM is header-only, so no building or linking is required.

## Build Instructions (Visual Studio 2022)

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    ```

2.  **Open the Visual Studio Solution:** Open the `OpenGL-AdvancedGLSL.sln` file in Visual Studio 2022.

3.  **Configure Include Directories:**
    *   In Solution Explorer, right-click on your project and select "Properties."
    *   Navigate to "C/C++" -> "General."
    *   In the "Additional Include Directories" field, add the paths to the GLEW header files and the GLM directory. For example:

        ```
        $(SolutionDir)Dependencies\GLEW\include;$(SolutionDir)Dependencies\GLM;$(IncludePath)
        ```

    (You might need to create a "Dependencies" folder in your solution directory and place GLEW and GLM folders within it)

4.  **Configure Library Directories:**
    *   Navigate to "Linker" -> "General."
    *   In the "Additional Library Directories" field, add the path to the GLEW library files (where `glew32.lib` is located). For example:

        ```
        $(SolutionDir)Dependencies\GLEW\lib\Release\Win32;$(LibraryPath)
        ```

    (Adjust the path according to your GLEW build configuration â€“ Win32 or x64, Debug or Release).

5.  **Configure Linker Input:**
    *   Navigate to "Linker" -> "Input."
    *   In the "Additional Dependencies" field, add the following libraries:

        ```
        opengl32.lib
        glew32.lib
        ```

6.  **Build the Solution:** Press Ctrl+Shift+B or select "Build" -> "Build Solution" to build the project.

7.  **Copy GLEW DLL:** Copy `glew32.dll` from GLEW build output directory (where you built GLEW) into the same directory as the compiled `.exe` file (Debug or Release directory).

## Usage

1.  **Run the Executable:** Run the compiled executable (located in the `Debug` or `Release` directory).

2.  **Explore Techniques:** The demo showcases various advanced GLSL techniques. You can explore them by [Explain how the user can interact with the demo.  E.g., "pressing different number keys," "modifying shader parameters in the code," or "using GUI elements if you have them"].

3.  **Code Modification:** You can modify the GLSL shaders (located in the `shaders` directory) to experiment with different effects. Rebuild the project to see the changes.
