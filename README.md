## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

*   **OpenGL:** The standard OpenGL library. Most systems already have OpenGL drivers installed. You may need to install or update your graphics drivers for optimal performance.

*   **GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library):** Used for loading OpenGL extensions.

    *   **Download:** [https://github.com/nigels-com/glew](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew)
    *   **Installation:**
        1.  Download the GLEW source code.
        2.  Extract the contents.
        3.  Build GLEW using the provided Visual Studio project (or your preferred method).
        4.  Copy the `glew32.lib` file to your project's library directory.
        5.  Copy the `glew32.dll` file to your project's executable directory or a location in your system's PATH.
        6.  Copy the GLEW header files (from the `include/GL` directory within the GLEW source) to your project's include directory.

*   **GLM (OpenGL Mathematics):** A header-only C++ mathematics library.

    *   **Download:** [https://github.com/g-truc/glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
    *   **Installation:** Simply copy the `glm` directory (containing the header files) to your project's include directory.

## Build Instructions (Visual Studio 2022)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Open the Visual Studio solution file (.sln):**
    Navigate to the project directory and open the `OpenGLVcxproj.sln` file (or similar) in Visual Studio 2022.
3.  **Configure Include Directories:**
    *   In Visual Studio, right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select "Properties".
    *   Go to "C/C++" -> "General" -> "Additional Include Directories".
    *   Add the following directories:
        *   The directory where you placed the GLEW header files (e.g., `C:\libs\glew\include`).
        *   The directory where you placed the GLM header files (e.g., `C:\libs\glm`).
4.  **Configure Library Directories:**
    *   Go to "Linker" -> "General" -> "Additional Library Directories".
    *   Add the directory where you placed the GLEW library file (e.g., `C:\libs\glew\lib\Release\Win32` or `C:\libs\glew\lib\Release\x64`, depending on your architecture).
5.  **Configure Linker Input:**
    *   Go to "Linker" -> "Input" -> "Additional Dependencies".
    *   Add `opengl32.lib` and `glew32.lib` to the list of dependencies.
6.  **Build the project:**
    *   Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" from the menu.
    *   Choose the appropriate build configuration (Debug or Release) and platform (Win32 or x64).

## Usage

1.  **Run the executable:**
    After building the project, you'll find the executable in the project's output directory (e.g., `Debug` or `Release`).
2.  **Explore the techniques:**
    The demo application showcases various advanced OpenGL techniques. You can typically cycle through different examples using [Explain how to control the demo â€“ e.g., keyboard keys, GUI elements].
3.  **Examine the code:**
    The source code for each technique is located in the `src` directory.  Examine the C++ and GLSL shader code to understand how the effects are implemented.
